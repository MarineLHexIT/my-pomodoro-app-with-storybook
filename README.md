# My Pomodoro App

From the [Practice Daily Ideas on Github](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), and to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) in a project, Iâ€™ve chosen to create a simple Pomodoro Timer. 

This project has been setup with Vite / React / Typescript

# How to see the components

```bash
    yarn storybook
```

and go to [Storybook Local Page (http://localhost:6006/)](http://localhost:6006/)

or
